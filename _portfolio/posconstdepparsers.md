The project was to do a set of tasks related to common tools used in Natural Language Processing (NLP). 
Mainly, PoS taggers, Constituency Parsers and Dependency Parsers.

I have a repository on my github page with all the code named [PoSConstDepParsers](https://github.com/PerezDavid-98/PoSConstDepParsers), the README on the repository explains all the project and also has a couple of notes regarding implementation and changes made.

All the code used and a PDF with the full report (in Spanish) can be found in the repo.

This project was done almost entirely (except the report, which was written in LaTeX locally) using [Google Colab](https://colab.google/) and all the training and inference were carried out in that platform, so some changes had to be made to accommodate the limitations (specially GPU usage time and memory consumption) of Google Colab.
